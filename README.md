As I was writing the first version, V1, I kept thinking about how I would do it "for real" rather than doing it the stripped down bare bones way, so after I got done with it I decided to make another version, V2, done in the manner I'd do if it were a "real" app. This was a nice illustrative exercise demonstrating different techniques you would apply depending on the app requirements, complexity, and other external constraints.

Now a V3 version!
